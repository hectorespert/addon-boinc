# Home Assistant Boinc Add-on

[BOINC](https://boinc.berkeley.edu) is an open-source software platform for computing using volunteered resources.

The BOINC add-on, running on your Home Assistant, downloads scientific computing jobs and runs them invisibly in the background.

## How to use

This add-on really only supports one Boinc project currently.
