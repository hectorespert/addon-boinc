# Home Assistant Boinc Add-on

[BOINC](https://boinc.berkeley.edu) is an open-source software platform for computing using volunteered resources.

The BOINC add-on, running on your Home Assistant, downloads scientific computing jobs and runs them invisibly in the background.

## How to use

Currently, this plugin only supports to attach boinc client to a [Boinc Account Manager](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/wiki/Account_managers).

[Science United](https://scienceunited.org) is recommended to simplify the process of start computing.

If you do not have an account created in an [account manager](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/wiki/Account_managers), you need to create it and use the same username and password in the addon configuration.

For example, in [Science United](https://scienceunited.org), you could sign up in this page: [Join Science United](https://scienceunited.org/su_join.php).
